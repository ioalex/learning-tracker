## Introduction 🤠

The purpose of this repository is to track my web development learning - and to perhaps, test my proficiency with Markdown! Here, you will find my current progress, ideas, resources and a developer's log that I will try to update regularly. 😎

The idea 💡 for this tracker came from Syk Houdeib's [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-tools-and-resources-that-landed-me-a-front-end-developer-job-1314c6f1fa7f/), where he shares his very own [tracker](https://github.com/Syknapse/My-Learning-Tracker). Thanks Syk!

I use Trello as a project management tool and have created a board to detail my learning plans. You can find that [here](https://trello.com/b/3p01dTFK/plan)!

I started a Discord community for learning Web Development! The server is active and full of people who share their ideas, help each other and love talking about all things web dev! You can join us by clicking this [link](https://discord.gg/PpvG3zY)!
