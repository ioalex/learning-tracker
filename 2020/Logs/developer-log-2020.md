## 2020

### May 20

I have been relatively busy with family commitments in the past couple of weeks and so I did not get as much learning done as I would have liked to. I have decided to take a short break from learning JavaScript. I have been using [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/web-development) to revisit HTML and CSS, to really cement the concepts in my head. I have also been using Maximilian's [CSS - The Complete Guide 2020 (incl. Flexbox, Grid & Sass)](https://www.udemy.com/course/css-the-complete-guide-incl-flexbox-grid-sass/) course which I have been really enjoying.

Been busy with other commitments for the past few days. Going to keep pushing through with the JavaScript course! I have been using an iPhone app called [Forest](https://www.forestapp.cc/) to maintain my focus when it comes to learning. The app is essentially a Pomodoro timer, albeit a very beautiful one, where for each time you concentrate for the specified amount of time, you 'plant' a tree in your virtual forest and gain some virtual coins. I definitely want to plant a nice looking forest!

Thanks to [Trees for the Future](https://trees.org/sponsor/forest-app/), 2500 virtual coins can be exchanged for a real tree planted in Sub Saharan Africa. I am going to do my best to use the app and plant a real tree! 🌳

### May 9

Update: I have been learning about ES5 and ES6 and their differences in the past few days. I have also gotten my feet wet with DOM Manipulation. Recently, I took a look at Apple's website because I wanted to take a look at the new Macbook Pro. I'm very impressed by their website, especially with their scroll animations. So I'm going to try make something similar!

### May 6

I have completed the Control Structures section in the course and have built two projects to apply that knowledge - a calculator app that does not exactly work like a traditional calculator (😜) and a monster killer game. Today, I had this book delivered to my door:

- [JavaScript & JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Developement by Jon Duckett](https://www.amazon.com.au/JavaScript-Jquery-Interactive-Front-end-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=asc_df_1118531647/?tag=googleshopdsk-22&linkCode=df0&hvadid=341743255824&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11484080568845607018&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9071449&hvtargid=pla-404294411926&psc=1)

I read Jon Duckett's other book on HTML and CSS, having really enjoyed the books visuals.

The book was recommended to me some kind people on the [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) which I recently started using. In the past week, I have read some interesting posts and ideas which I have saved for future reference.

I have also created a StackOverflow [account](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13161343/alexhecodes). I think that answering questions others may have is a great way for myself to reinforce my learning - although I have a lot of learning to do before I am comfortable enough! 😅

### May 1

Learning about control structures through Maximilian's course. I can understand how important if Statements and Loops are to JavaScript and programming in general, and how they can help to write clean, efficient code. Looking forward to try build something soon!

I have also switched over to using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) from Microsoft's OneNote as my note-taking app. I definitely feel more at home using it! 😛

### April 30

In the past week I have been learning JavaScript from scratch, using the following resources:

- [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/)
- [JavaScript Info](https://javascript.info/)
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

I am particularly enjoying the course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller as he explains things very well. Overall, I find JavaScript much more fun to learn than HTML and CSS, perhaps due to its dynamic nature.
