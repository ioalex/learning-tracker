### May 1

Learning about control structures through Maximilian's course. I can understand how important if Statements and Loops are to JavaScript and programming in general, and how they can help to write clean, efficient code. Looking forward to try build something soon!

I have also switched over to using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) from Microsoft's OneNote. I definitely feel more at home using it!

### April 30

In the past week I have been learning JavaScript from scratch, using the following resources:

- [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/)
- [JavaScript Info](https://javascript.info/)
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

I am particularly enjoying the course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller as he explains things very well. Overall, I find JavaScript much more fun to learn than HTML and CSS, perhaps due to its dynamic nature.
