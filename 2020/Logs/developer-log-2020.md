### May 9

Update: I have been learning about ES5 and ES6 and their differences in the past few days. I have also gotten my feet wet with DOM Manipulation. Recently, I took a look at Apple's website because I wanted to take a look at the new Macbook Pro. I'm very impressed by their website, especially with their scroll animations. So I'm going to try make something similar!

### May 6

I have completed the Control Structures section in the course and have built two projects to apply that knowledge - a calculator app that does not exactly work like a traditional calculator (😜) and a monster killer game. Today, I had this book delivered to my door:

- [JavaScript & JQuery: Interactive Front-end Web Developement by Jon Duckett](https://www.amazon.com.au/JavaScript-Jquery-Interactive-Front-end-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=asc_df_1118531647/?tag=googleshopdsk-22&linkCode=df0&hvadid=341743255824&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11484080568845607018&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9071449&hvtargid=pla-404294411926&psc=1)

I read Jon Duckett's other book on HTML and CSS, having really enjoyed the books visuals.

The book was recommended to me some kind people on the [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) which I recently started using. In the past week, I have read some interesting posts and ideas which I have saved for future reference.

I have also created a StackOverflow [account](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13161343/alexhecodes). I think that answering questions others may have is a great way for myself to reinforce my learning - although I have a lot of learning to do before I am comfortable enough! 😅

### May 1

Learning about control structures through Maximilian's course. I can understand how important if Statements and Loops are to JavaScript and programming in general, and how they can help to write clean, efficient code. Looking forward to try build something soon!

I have also switched over to using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) from Microsoft's OneNote as my note-taking app. I definitely feel more at home using it! 😛

### April 30

In the past week I have been learning JavaScript from scratch, using the following resources:

- [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/)
- [JavaScript Info](https://javascript.info/)
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

I am particularly enjoying the course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller as he explains things very well. Overall, I find JavaScript much more fun to learn than HTML and CSS, perhaps due to its dynamic nature.
