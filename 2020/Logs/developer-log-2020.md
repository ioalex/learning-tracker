### April 30

In the past week I have been learning JavaScript from scratch, using the following resources:

- [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/)
- [JavaScript Info](https://javascript.info/)
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)
- [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

I am particularly enjoying the course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller as he explains things very well. Overall, I find JavaScript much more fun to learn than HTML and CSS, perhaps due to its dynamic nature.
