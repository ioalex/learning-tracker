# Alex's Developer Log 📖

## 2020

## July 16

I've spent the past few days working on my side hustle. Today, I learnt how to use Netlify to host my side hustle website. It's a pretty smooth process. I'm having a lot of fun! 😜

Things I learnt today:

- What is a REST API?
- Why do we need a REST API?

I am planning to learn how to build a RESTful API with Node.js. I want to implement that knowledge for my side business project.

I am looking to restart this developer log as I have not made an entry in almost 2 months (I know, I'm sorry!! 😅 ). You can find my previous entries in the [Archive](../Archive/archive-2020.md) folder.

In the time I was absent, I have learnt and become more confident in using the Command Line, SASS to write CSS and using build tools like Gulp. I have also advanced further in the [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/) course.

Some things I wanted to share:

- I am currently using iTerm2 as my Terminal replacement and am running ZSH as my Unix shell.

- I have written a Gulp workflow for general front-end projects that I am falling in love with and will be pushing it to GitHub.

- I am in the process of building a website for a side business project with my brother.

Thanks for reading! I'll be uploading a lot more regularly, I promise! 😜
