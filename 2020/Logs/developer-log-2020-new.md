# Alex's Developer Log 📖

## 2020

## October 5

Whoops, haven't posted an entry in a month! 🙃

I've configured my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ioalex/dotfiles) and I'm pretty happy with them so far. Though, I will most likely be continually changing them.

I've made some updates to [Gobble](https://github.com/ioalex/gobble) to rid of some silly silly mistakes and have added linting for many filetypes.

I'm still working on my side business with my brother. Its been a slow process but I'm happy with the progress we've made. The website is coming together. The aim is that we can launch sometime next year.

## September 2

Still trying to configure Neovim to my liking.

It's not an easy task as there is so much that can be customised!

I want to add a lot of the features I like from VSCode into my Vim experience.

---

## August 31

I am trying to learn Vim! Nothing against VSCode, but I couldn't help but be drawn to Vim.

I'm having a lot of fun customizing Vim to have IDE-like features such as autocompletion - so far so good!

I am using the Neovim fork as it seems that its the way most Vim-users are rocking with now. My current dotfiles for Neovim are available [here](https://github.com/ioalex/nvim).

## August 30

Discovered a Git client app for iOS called [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) and downloaded it straight away. Hopefully this app will help me to log entries here more often! 😛

5 hours later...

I've finally finished [Gobble](https://github.com/ioalex/gobble.git), an opinionated boilerplate for starting static web page projects quickly! It relies heavily on the task runner Gulp. I'm pretty happy with what I've done with it. I had my first real shot at writing legit documentation for this project and hope I only improve from here. Let's go!! 🚀🚀🚀

## August 29

I've been working on my side business. It's been fun yet I can't deny that its been a little frustrating, especially on the logistic side of things.

Other than that, I've been learning how to use Webpack and Nunjucks. I am writing up an opinionated boilerplate called [Gobble](https://github.com/ioalex/gobble) to start web development projects more quickly.

I am also in the process of creating a CLI tool called [Jarvis](https://github.com/ioalex/jarvis) that I will use for the same purpose, however with Jarvis, it is less opinionated and I will be able to select what tools I need every time I boot-up the CLI. Jarvis will then inject my pre-configured configuration files for said tools into the new project.

Some time in the future, I would like to create a Jarvis spin-off of sorts that will allow others to create their own CLI tool that does the same.

## August 19

Still building the website for my side business! 😛

Been enjoying the process and also learning more about Git and GitHub at the same time.

I've set up a GitHub Action for Google's Lighthouse CI to launch an audit every time I make a push or pull request to master. Very cool.

## August 9

I have been busy building the website for my side gig. It's been fun but at times frustrating as there are many things to think about as we're dealing with customers and money. I should probably commit more often! Haha 😅

---

## July 24

I have been building a rock-paper-scissors game. I have gotten the core game logic down. I plan to add multiplayer functionality in future with Sockets io.

---

## July 19

Today I learnt some Node.js basics. I am going through a course on Codecademy. Pretty cool to see JavaScript out of the browser.

---

## July 17

Today I spent some time looking through localisation (l18n) solutions for my side gig. I plan to use the l18next framework. I also had a look at some micro JS libraries. It's pretty amazing to see powerful libraries that are really small in file size.

---

## July 16

I've spent the past few days working on my side hustle. Today, I learnt how to use Netlify to host my side hustle website. It's a pretty smooth process. I'm having a lot of fun! 😜

---

## July 13

Things I learnt today:

- What is a REST API?
- Why do we need a REST API?

I am planning to learn how to build a RESTful API with Node.js. I want to implement that knowledge for my side business project.

### July 12

I am looking to restart this developer log as I have not made an entry in almost 2 months (I know, I'm sorry!! 😅 ). You can find my previous entries in the [Archive](../Archive/archive-2020.md) folder.

In the time I was absent, I have learnt and become more confident in using the Command Line, SASS to write CSS and using build tools like Gulp. I have also advanced further in the [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/) course.

Some things I wanted to share:

- I am currently using iTerm2 as my Terminal replacement and am running ZSH as my Unix shell.

- I have written a Gulp workflow for general front-end projects that I am falling in love with and will be pushing it to GitHub.

- I am in the process of building a website for a side business project with my brother.

Thanks for reading! I'll be uploading a lot more regularly, I promise! 😜
