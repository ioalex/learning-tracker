# Alex's Developer Log 📖

## 2020

## August 19

Still building the website for my side business! 😛

Been enjoying the process and also learning more about Git and GitHub at the same time.

I've set up a GitHub Action for Google's Lighthouse CI to launch an audit every time I make a push or pull request to master. Very cool.

## August 9

I have been busy building the website for my side gig. It's been fun but at times frustrating as there are many things to think about as we're dealing with customers and money. I should probably commit more often! Haha 😅

## July 24

I have been building a rock-paper-scissors game. I have gotten the core game logic down. I plan to add multiplayer functionality in future with Sockets io.

## July 19

Today I learnt some Node.js basics. I am going through a course on Codecademy. Pretty cool to see JavaScript out of the browser.

---

## July 17

Today I spent some time looking through localisation (l18n) solutions for my side gig. I plan to use the l18next framework. I also had a look at some micro JS libraries. It's pretty amazing to see powerful libraries that are really small in file size.

## July 16

I've spent the past few days working on my side hustle. Today, I learnt how to use Netlify to host my side hustle website. It's a pretty smooth process. I'm having a lot of fun! 😜

## July 13

Things I learnt today:

- What is a REST API?
- Why do we need a REST API?

I am planning to learn how to build a RESTful API with Node.js. I want to implement that knowledge for my side business project.

I am looking to restart this developer log as I have not made an entry in almost 2 months (I know, I'm sorry!! 😅 ). You can find my previous entries in the [Archive](../Archive/archive-2020.md) folder.

In the time I was absent, I have learnt and become more confident in using the Command Line, SASS to write CSS and using build tools like Gulp. I have also advanced further in the [JavaScript - The Complete Guide 2020 (Beginner + Advanced)](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-the-complete-guide-2020-beginner-advanced/) course.

Some things I wanted to share:

- I am currently using iTerm2 as my Terminal replacement and am running ZSH as my Unix shell.

- I have written a Gulp workflow for general front-end projects that I am falling in love with and will be pushing it to GitHub.

- I am in the process of building a website for a side business project with my brother.

Thanks for reading! I'll be uploading a lot more regularly, I promise! 😜
